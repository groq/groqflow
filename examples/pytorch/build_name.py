"""
    This example demonstrates changing the directory name within the cache directory
    (~/.cache/groqflow) where all the logs, artifacts, and the state file will be written.

    To change the directory name, use the build_name argument with a unique name.

    The directory for each build defaults to the name of the file it was built in;
    'build_name' would be the default for this file.

    Note: If a single script is used to build multiple models, (or if a build_name
    matches a build directory within cache already), then a unique build_name will
    need to be defined, or the subsequent build(s) will overwrite (or load) the
    previous build found in ~/.cache/groqflow/{non_unique_build_name}.
    See docs/user_guide.md for more information.
