"""
    This example is built to demonstrate groqit()'s rebuild = "always" setting.

    groqit() will always rebuild the model, even when a build of that model is
    found in the GroqFlow build cache, when the `rebuild` argument is set to
    "always".

    You can demonstrate the functionality for rebuild="always" by running this
    script twice and seeing that the model still gets rebuilt even when the model
    is cached and there are no changes to the model.
