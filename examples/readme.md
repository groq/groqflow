# GroqFlowâ„¢ Examples

This folder contains examples that demonstrate the use of `groqit()` arguments and `GroqModel` methods.

You can learn more about the concepts demonstrated in the examples by referencing the GroqFlow User Guide at `docs/user_guide.md`.

## Groq Tool Requirements

The Groq tools packages and the **Quick Start Guide** can be found at the [Groq Customer Portal](https://support.groq.com/)

- To build a `groq_model` the `groq-devtools` package should be installed.
- To run a `GroqModel` on hardware the `groq-runtime` package should be installed.
- Both Groq packages should be installed to enable both a build and to run on hardware
  from the same script.

## Understanding Examples

Here are some properties shared by all of the examples:

- Each example will create a build directory in the GroqFlow build cache, which is located at `~/.cache/groqflow` by default.
  - **Note**: Most builds will load from this cache after the first time you run them, as opposed to rebuilding, unless otherwise specified in the example (check out the `rebuild` argument and its examples to change this behavior).
  - **Note**: Most examples set `torch.manual_seed(0)` or `tf.random.set_seed(0)`, unless otherwise specified in the example, which prevents the randomly generated weights in the example from changing between runs.
- The build directory will be named after the example unless the example specifies a name change with the `build_name` argument (see the `build_name.py` example).
- The model being built in each example is a small one- or two-layer fully-connected graph.

## Running Examples

To run any of the examples, open a terminal and type the following command:

```python
python /path/to/example/example_name.py
```
